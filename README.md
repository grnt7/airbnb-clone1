A concise and compelling description of your project. What is its core purpose? What problem does it solve? What makes it unique or interesting?
The Airbnb Clone is a comprehensive frontend application that mimics the core user experience of the popular lodging marketplace. Its main purpose is to showcase advanced frontend development skills by building a dynamic, feature-rich web interface.

This project demonstrates how to solve complex challenges like integrating third-party APIs (Mapbox), managing state for interactive components (calendar date picker), and optimizing performance with a server-side rendered framework like Next.js.

What makes it unique is the complete, end-to-end approach. It’s a fully functional clone of a globally recognized platform, combining Next.js for performance, Mapbox for interactive maps, and a clean, responsive UI built with modern React principles to create a powerful and realistic demonstration of advanced frontend skills.
